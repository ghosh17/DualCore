# DualCoreProcessor
ASIC Design lab. Pipelined, Cached, Multicore MIPS Processor

The Computer Architecture & Processor Prototyping Lab project uses Computer Design and Prototyping. The goal of this projet is to build a Dual Core MIPS processor that is pipelined, cached and multicored usng modern CAD tools, logic simulation, logic synthesis using
hardware description languages and design hierarchy. I used System Verilog and an FPGA based prototyping board to rapidly develop and test prototypes of CPU designs.

Please Refer to report.pdf for more information on the design as well the detailed structure of all the blocks.
